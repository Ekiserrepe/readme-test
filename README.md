### About Xahau

Xahau is a blockchain known for its transaction throughput, speed and the low fees. Combined with available advanced transaction types like multi sign, escrows, payment channels and even a decentralized exchange (all on ledger, out of the box, without requiring smart contracts) Xahau has a lot to offer businesses and (creative) developers.

Hooks (an exclusive feature for Xahau) add smart contract functionality to Xahau: layer one custom code to influence the behaviour and flow of transactions. Hooks are small, efficient pieces of code being defined on an Xahau account, allowing logic to be executed before and/or after Xahau transactions. These Hooks can be really simple, like: “reject payments < 10 XAH”, or “for all outgoing payments, send 10% to my savings account” or more advanced.
